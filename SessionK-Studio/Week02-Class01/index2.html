<h1>THINGS</h1>
	<H2>A story of the sixties</H2>
	<h3>Georges Perec</h3>
	<p>
		Your eye, <br>
		first of all, <br>
		would glide over the grey fitted carpet in the narrow, <br>
		long and high-ceilinged corridor. <br>
		Its walls would be cupboards, <br>
		in light-coloured wood, <br>
		with fittings of gleaming brass.<br> 
		Three prints, <br>
		depicting, <br>
		respectively, <br>
		the Derby winner Thunderbird, <br>
		a paddle-steamer named Ville-de-Motitereau,<br> 
		and a Stephenson locomotive, <br>
		would lead to a leather curtain hanging on thick, <br>
		black, <br>
		grainy wooden rings which would slide back at the merest touch. <br>
		There, <br>
		the carpet would give way to an almost yellow woodblock floor, <br>
		partly covered by three faded rugs.<br>


It would be a living room about twenty-three feet long by ten feet wide.<br> 
On the left, <br>
in a kind of recess, <br>
there would be a large sofa upholstered in worn black leather, <br>
with pale cherrywood bookcases on either side, <br>
heaped with books in untidy piles. <br>
Above the sofa, <br>
a mariner's chart would fill the whole length of that section of the wall. <br>
On the other side of a small low table, <br>
and beneath a silk prayer-mat nailed to the wall with three large-headed brass studs, <br>
matching the leather curtain, <br>
there would be another sofa, <br>
at right angles to the first, <br>
with a light-brown velvet covering; <br>
it would lead on to a small and spindly piece of furniture, <br>
lacquered in dark red and providing three display shelves for knick-knacks: <br>agates and stone eggs, <br>
snuffboxes, <br>
candy-boxes, <br>
jade ashtrays, <br>
a mother-of-pearl oystershell, <br>
a silver fob watch, <br>
a cut-glass glass, <br>
a crystal pyramid, <br>
a miniature in an oval frame. <br>
Further on, <br>
beyond a padded door, <br>
there would be shelving on both sides of the corner, <br>
for caskets and for records, <br>
beside a closed gramophone of which only four machined-steel knobs would be visible, <br>
and above it, <br>
a print depicting The Great Parade of the Military Tattoo. <br>
Through the window, <br>
draped with white and brown curtains in cloth imitating Jouy wallpaper, <br>
you would glimpse a few trees, <br>
a tiny park, <br>
a bit of street. <br>
A roll-top desk littered with papers and pen-holders would go with a small cane-seated chair. <br>
On a console table would be a telephone, <br>
a leather diary, <br>
a writing pad. 
Then, <br>
on the other side of another door, <br>
beyond a low, <br>
square revolving bookcase supporting a large, <br>
cylindrical vase decorated in blue and filled with yellow roses, <br>
set beneath an oblong mirror in a mahogany frame, <br>
there would be a narrow table with its two benches upholstered in tartan, <br>
which would bring your eye back to the leather curtain.<br>
