<p class = "text1">It was ray, the ex boyfriend and Francene, the twin. Ray was writing in a notepad with the exact same paper as the killers note. However he was right-handed. Notice the smudge on the left hand side of the note? It had to have been written by somebody else (Francene). Ray also said that he had been injured playing basketball. Francene had a basketball in her room, and despite her tears, she neglected to use the tissues right next to her. Ray also said that he had started seeing someone new. The two of them were in cahoots so that they could kill Jenny and cut to canoodling.
