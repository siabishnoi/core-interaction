  <p>Fluff it up a little and hypnotize it. We must be quiet, soft and gentle. Isn't that fantastic that you can create an almighty tree that fast? You better get your coat out, this is going to be a cold painting. There's not a thing in the world wrong with washing your brush.</p>

<p>The more we do this - the more it will do good things to our heart. We can always carry this a step further. There's really no end to this. Work that paint. I'm sort of a softy, I couldn't shoot Bambi except with a camera. Only eight colors that you need. If you hypnotize it, it will go away.The more we do this - the more it will do good things to our heart. We can always carry this a step further. There's really no end to this. Work that paint. I'm sort of a softy, I couldn't shoot Bambi except with a camera. Only eight colors that you need. If you hypnotize it, it will go away</p>

<p>If you do too much it's going to lose its effectiveness. Get away from those little Christmas tree things we used to make in school. Here's something that's fun. Once you learn the technique, ohhh! Turn you loose on the world; you become a tiger. There we go. That's a son of a gun of a cloud.The more we do this - the more it will do good things to our heart. We can always carry this a step further. There's really no end to this. Work that paint. I'm sort of a softy, I couldn't shoot Bambi except with a camera. Only eight colors that you need. If you hypnotize it, it will go away</p>

<p>Let all these things just sort of happen. Those great big fluffy clouds. Just think about these things in your mind and drop em' on canvas. Let's make some happy little clouds in our world.The more we do this - the more it will do good things to our heart. We can always carry this a step further. There's really no end to this.

<p>No worries. No cares. Just float and wait for the wind to blow you around. Let your heart take you to wherever you want to be. Trees live in your fan brush, but you have to scare them out.</p>

<p>Just pretend you are a whisper floating across a mountain. You gotta think like a tree. You can't have light without dark. You can't know happiness unless you've known sorrow. I want everbody to be happy. That's what it's all about.</p>

<p>You have freedom here. The only guide is your heart. Let's build some happy little clouds up here. We start with a vision in our heart, and we put it on canvas. Painting should do one thing. It should put happiness in your heart. Use absolutely no pressure. Just like an angel's wing. Let that brush dance around there and play.</p>

<p>We have all at one time or another mixed some mud. Let's have a little bit of fun today. If you don't think every day is a good day - try missing a few. You'll see. A big strong tree needs big strong roots.</p>

<p>Let all these little things happen. Don't fight them. Learn to use them. Maybe there's a happy little Evergreen that lives here. We'll have a super time. Isn't that fantastic?</p>

<p>That's what painting is all about. It should make you feel good when you paint. This is probably the greatest thing to happen in my life - to be able to share this with you. Life is too short to be alone, too precious. Share it with a friend. We'll put some happy little leaves here and there. The first step to doing anything is to believe you can do it. See it finished in your mind before you ever start.</p>

    <p>And just raise cain. I'm sort of a softy, I couldn't shoot Bambi except with a camera. We have all at one time or another mixed some mud. Anyone can paint.</p>

<p>Sometimes you learn more from your mistakes than you do from your masterpieces. This is your creation - and it's just as unique and special as you are. You don't have to be crazy to do this but it does help. I guess I'm a little weird. I like to talk to trees and animals. That's okay though; I have more fun than most people. We don't have anything but happy trees here. This is probably the greatest thing to happen in my life - to be able to share this with you.</p>

<p>We must be quiet, soft and gentle. You want your tree to have some character. Make it special. The little tiny Tim easels will let you down.</p>

<p>If there's two big trees invariably sooner or later there's gonna be a little tree. What the devil. This is an example of what you can do with just a few things, a little imagination and a happy dream in your heart. I'm gonna start with a little Alizarin crimson and a touch of Prussian blue You can create beautiful things - but you have to see them in your mind first.</p>

<p>I can't think of anything more rewarding than being able to express yourself to others through painting. We don't have to be committed. We are just playing here. We're not trying to teach you a thing to copy. We're just here to teach you a technique, then let you loose into the world. Let's have a nice tree right here.</p>

  <p>Nice little clouds playing around in the sky. We don't have to be concerned about it. We just have to let it fall where it will. Let's make some happy little clouds in our world. Everyone is going to see things differently - and that's the way it should be. Go out on a limb - that's where the fruit is.</p>

<p>As trees get older they lose their chlorophyll. Even the worst thing we can do here is good. Here we're limited by the time we have. I'm gonna start with a little Alizarin crimson and a touch of Prussian blue We'll do another happy little painting.</p>

<p>These trees are so much fun. I get started on them and I have a hard time stopping. Put your feelings into it, your heart, it's your world. This is truly an almighty mountain.</p>

<p>We're not trying to teach you a thing to copy. We're just here to teach you a technique, then let you loose into the world. Now, we're going to fluff this cloud. This is your creation - and it's just as unique and special as you are. That's crazy. Get away from those little Christmas tree things we used to make in school.</p>
